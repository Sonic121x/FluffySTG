changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixes a half-port accidentally causing the Dwoop emote to be usable by not just synths and silicons, but every single living entity except non-synth humans. It is now fully ported to the new silicon emotes system, allowing it to be used by everything that can use silicon emotes."
  - bugfix: "Robotic lizard voicebox allows silicon emotes parallel to the stock robotic voicebox."
