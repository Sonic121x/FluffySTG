      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)
      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material

      wraiths are now extra cruel and will attack the lowest-health mob they can see

      price of 14 TC.
  - qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on their
      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
      their baseline equipment NOW.
  - qol: To avoid poor magazine discipline, most combat-ready personnel have instructed
      _not_ to put magazines into the gun loops on their armor vests.

      a maximum of 5 times before giving up and thus preventing infinite loops, high
      tick usage

  - spellcheck: basic mobs getting shoved by humans now display the mob's disarm response
  lizardqueenlexi:
  - refactor: Proteon constructs now use the basic mob framework. The ones encountered
      in ruins are a bit flightier now, and will briefly flee combat if attacked -
      only so that they can return and menace you again soon after. Please report
      any bugs.
