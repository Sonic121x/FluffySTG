  yooriss:
  - qol: 'The telepathy genetics mutation has had significant usability improvements:
      it is now point-targeting based, and right-clicking the power allows for quick
      resending to the same target, a feature mirrored by the new *treply emote. Telepathy
      now also shows runechat messages.'
  - rscadd: The Telepathic quirk has been added, allowing characters to start with
      an unremovable (or activated) telepathy mutation.
  - rscadd: A new form of emoting is available called 'Do', accessible via the K and
      Ctrl-K keybinds by default (as well as the 'Do' verb). Do doesn't put your character
      name first and instead includes it in brackets at the end, so you can use it
      to write better prose and even narrate things in the environment around you
      with less clunkiness! Try it out today.

      for you and your friends today!
  - rscadd: The Entombed quirk has been added, allowing characters to start off with
      a permanently unremovable low-end MODsuit stuck to their back slot. Letting
      the suit's charge run low will eventually kill you, and the quirk has special
      interactions with both Ethereals and Plasmamen!
